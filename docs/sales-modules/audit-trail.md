![pricing plans](/img/sales/audit-trail/audittrail.png)

The Audit Trail provides a chronological log of all significant actions and changes made to sales orders across the system. Accessible via Sales and Marketing > Audit Trail, it displays a list of updates with details such as the SalesOrder ID, type of action (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected,Draft), user who performed the action, and the exact date of the change. Each entry includes a clear description of what occurred, ensuring complete traceability and visibility into the order lifecycle from creation through submission, review, and final decision.
