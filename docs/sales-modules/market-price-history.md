The Market Price History table maintains a comprehensive, date-wise record of market prices entered for individual sellable items. Accessible via Sales and Marketing > Market Price History, it displays a chronological table listing all price entries with columns for item code, item name, unit of measure, market price, the user who created the entry, and the date of entry. Users can search the list to locate specific items or price records efficiently.
