## Sales Request

![sales request](/img/sales/salesrequest/salsesrequest.png)

The Sales Requests feature displays all sales orders that have been submitted from the Sales Orders table for review and final authorization. Accessible via Sales and Marketing > Sales Requests, it presents a table listing pending requests with essential details including order ID, status (typically Pending), delivery date, total discount, total VAT, final total amount, client name, number of items, and the creating user. Users can search for specific requests to quickly locate entries.
Each request row includes an Action column with options to view order details, download related documents, and where authorized “approve or reject” the request using clearly marked buttons. Approval advances the order to Approved status for further processing, while rejection returns it with appropriate feedback. This step ensures proper oversight and validation before orders proceed to fulfillment.
