The Expired Orders feature lists all approved sales orders whose specified delivery date has passed the current date without further processing or fulfillment. Accessible via Sales and Marketing > Expired Orders, it presents a table displaying these overdue orders with details including order ID, client name, status, delivery date, sub total, total VAT, final total amount, number of items, creating user, and available actions. Users can search the list to quickly identify specific expired entries. Each row provides a “view” action for reviewing order details.
